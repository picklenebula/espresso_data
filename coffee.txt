AEROPRESS STUFF:

Brew 1 to 15
18g coffee 300g water (or maybe try 20g 300g)

Aero press steep for 2mins

Swirl a little before ‚Äòpressing‚Äô

French press:

47g of beans to 800g of filtered water:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†grind fresh at medium-course (almost kosher salt)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†boil filtered water to 205F (enough for 1:17 ratio)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†put the grinds in the press ON A SCALE, tare to 0
‚Ä¢	‚Å†first pour saturates the grounds, allow it to bloom for 30 seconds. I usually put in about 3-4 times water as coffee
‚Ä¢	‚Å†break the crust with a ceramic spoon, gently submerging all of the grounds
‚Ä¢	‚Å†pour the remaining water, then put on the plunger/lid.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†total brew time should be 4:00-4:15
